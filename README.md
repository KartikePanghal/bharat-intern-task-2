# Cat and Dog Image Classifier
This project is an image classification model that uses Python deep learning techniques to differentiate between photographs of cats and dogs. TensorFlow and Keras are used in the model's construction, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to provide precise picture identification. The "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle is the dataset that was utilized, and data augmentation is employed throughout the model's training to enhance generalization. The repository contains instructions on configuring the environment, obtaining the dataset, and executing the script in addition to the Python code for model training, evaluation, and prediction. Ideal for anyone who want to learn more about picture categorization and computer vision!
